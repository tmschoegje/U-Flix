Playing around with crawling and making a search engine for some public Municipality of Utrecht websites and data

Instruction on how to play are in the readmes/top comments of code in the Elastic, then Webserver, and finally Interface folders
Note: Might need to disable the browser security feature to disable CORS for how the interface and webserver talk (remnant of logging tool code). I should look into that sometime.
In the interface, switch search engines in the URL/code using se=g (google custom search), poc (this elastic one, default), oris (older, different dataset)

todo: link this search engine to the logging tool I should finish, so it's easy for information seeking process observation studies
